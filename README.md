## Overview

USOR (United States Oil Reserve) is a high-performance digital asset protocol dedicated to the conceptual tokenization of strategic energy reserves. By bridging traditional macro-economic energy indicators with decentralized finance, USOR establishes a transparent, data-driven "Strategic Digital Oil Pulse" on the Solana blockchain.

Built for the next era of American energy sovereignty, USOR leverages institutional-grade telemetry and hyper-scale liquidity pathing via the Jupiter Aggregator.
