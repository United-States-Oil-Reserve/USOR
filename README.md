<img src="assets/logo.png" alt="USOR Logo" width="120"/>

**Securing the Future of Sovereign Energy through Institutional Digital Tokenization**

---

## Overview

USOR (United States Oil Reserve) is a high-performance digital asset protocol dedicated to the conceptual tokenization of strategic energy reserves. By bridging traditional macro-economic energy indicators with decentralized finance, USOR establishes a transparent, data-driven "Strategic Digital Oil Pulse" on the Solana blockchain.

Built for the next era of American energy sovereignty, USOR leverages institutional-grade telemetry and hyper-scale liquidity pathing via the Jupiter Aggregator.

- **Institutional Telemetry**: Advanced dashboards showing market cap strength, liquidity depth, and treasury allocations
- **Sovereign Tokenomics**: Designed for long-term holders contributing to the on-chain energy narrative

### Infrastructure Excellence
- **Solana Mainnet Engine**: Sub-second execution and parallelized VM performance
- **Aggregator Integration**: Direct hook into Jupiter for optimal acquisition pathing
- **AES-256 Grade Security**: Encrypted data streams and verified smart contract layers

### Premium Mission Control Aesthetic
